    "1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.\n",

    "If you prefer the notebook environment, you can copy and paste the code for each exercise into a new, blank notebook.\n\n",
    "1.  Create a new, empty Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "2.  Open the `week1/week1_day2_exercises.py` file in a text editor.\n",
